#  🚀 RustyJS (RUJS): A JavaScript Engine Made from Scratch in Rust (Kind Of)

> Disclaimer: This is a highly experimental project fueled by hubris, caffeine, and the misguided belief that “how hard could it be?” Spoiler: It’s very hard. RustyJS will probably never be completed. Proceed with curiosity, laughter, and very low expectations.

## 🌟 Welcome to RustyJS

RustyJS is a bold (read: absurd) attempt to build a JavaScript engine entirely from scratch using Rust. Why? Because learning Rust while implementing one of the most complex things in computer science is obviously a brilliant idea. What could possibly go wrong? (Everything.)

## 🚨 Warning!
-	This is not production-ready. It’s not even close to being “ready” for anything except being laughed at.
-	Expect bugs, dragons 🐉, and existential crises.
-	If you actually try to use this in a real project, you’re braver than we are. Good luck, warrior. 🛡️

## 🎯 Project Goals
1. Learn Rust: Because memory safety, ownership, and “the borrow checker” sounded fun until we met them.
2. Understand JavaScript internals: Or at least pretend to.
3. Reinvent the wheel: But square-shaped and slightly on fire.
4. Make something that sort of works: Maybe… eventually… if the stars align.

🛠️ Installation (If You Dare)

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rustyjs.git
cd rustyjs`
```

2. Build the project:
```
cargo build
```

3.	Run the thing:
(Lower your expectations.)
```
cargo run
```

## 🙃 Why Would You Use This?

You wouldn’t. But if you want a cautionary tale about overestimating your programming abilities, RustyJS is here for you.

## 🧙 Contributing

If you want to help, we won’t stop you. Just know what you’re signing up for:
- Sleepless nights.
- Wrestling with Rust’s borrow checker.
- Wondering why you thought JavaScript needed another engine.

Steps to Contribute:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Write some code that does something vaguely JavaScript-y
3. Submit a PR.
4. Laugh maniacally when it’s merged.

## 🦀 Special Thanks

To Rust, for teaching us humility. To JavaScript, for existing just to torment us. ChatGPT to help writing funny READMEs. And to you, for reading this far, you’re a hero.
